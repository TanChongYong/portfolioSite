# Our Approach

![](//localhost:1313/360pro/img/initial.PNG)

Our initial approach was to simply break down each part of the html syntax into digestible bits. While it did work in conveying the concepts to students, we were unable to keep their attention for long! We decided to pivot to include items that the students were able to relate to more.

# The Pivot

After pivoting, we decided to include Pokemon to teach the students. The reception was much better, and students love that they were able to have full control of their site with their favorite Pokemon characters.

 Through this small inclusion, students were immensely happier and their learning increased tremendously!

# Next Steps

Syntax World has been a fun project to work on. Our team is now taking things slower due to a focus on our careers, but if we have the spare capacity in the future we will return to build it up again!
